C   N IS CALLED ZN HERE SO THAT IT HAS THE RIGHT TYPE
           X = A0
           Y = A0 + 2. * EPS
C   Yâ€™S VALUE DOES NOT MATTER SO LONG AS ABS(X-Y).GT.EPS
     100   IF ABS(X-Y).LE.EPS GOTO 200
           Y=X
           X = (X + ZN/X) / 2. GOTO 100
     200   CONTINUE
C   THE SQUARE ROOT OF ZN IS NOW IN X.
